🖍️ Etch-A-Sketch – DOM Sketchpad
📘 Description
This is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch project created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It simulates a sketchpad where users can draw by hovering over a grid of squares. The grid responds to mouse events and includes interactive features like color change, reset, and dynamic grid resizing.

This project emphasizes DOM manipulation, Flexbox layout, event handling, and dynamic content generation in JavaScript.

🎯 Goal and Skills
The goal of this project is to build a dynamic, interactive sketchpad that:

Generates a grid using JavaScript

Reacts to user interaction via mouse events

Allows customization of the grid size (up to 100×100)

Resets and redraws the grid dynamically

Implements hover-based coloring effects, including:

Solid color trail

Random RGB color trail

Gradual darkening per square

✅ Skills Demonstrated
DOM manipulation using document.createElement, appendChild, and querySelector

Flexbox layout to create a responsive grid

Handling mouse events (mouseover, click)

Using prompt() for user input

Using loops and functions to dynamically generate and modify elements

Applying and modifying inline styles and classes via JavaScript

Working with color values and opacity

Using Math.random() to generate RGB values

Validating and constraining user input

Refactoring code for modularity and readability

🔧 How to Run
Open index.html in any modern browser

Hover over the grid to start drawing

Use the "Resize Grid" button to create a new grid with custom dimensions

Depending on the version, additional buttons may include:

"Clear" to reset the drawing

"Random Color" to activate randomized RGB mode

"Darken Mode" to progressively darken each square

💡 Max grid size is limited to 100×100 to maintain performance.

🌟 Extra Features (Bonus)
🎨 Random RGB color per square interaction

🌑 Gradual darkening with each hover (10 steps to black)

📐 Responsive design to fit various screen sizes

🧼 Clear button to reset the grid without changing its size

🧩 Modular JavaScript for easy extensibility
